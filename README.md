# OPTIMADE Providers Index Meta-Database

The list of providers is published as an [OPTIMADE](https://www.optimade.org/) Index Meta-Database here: [https://providers.optimade.org/](https://providers.optimade.org/)

You can obtain the list of providers in a machine-readable format following the [OPTIMADE specification for Index Meta-Databases](https://github.com/Materials-Consortia/OPTIMADE/blob/develop/optimade.rst#32index-meta-database) by using the following URL:

- [https://providers.optimade.org/v1/links](https://providers.optimade.org/v1/links)

where `v1` is currently the latest version and can be replaced with any major version name of the OPTIMADE specification.

For convenience, you can also access the most recent list of providers in the format mandated by the latest version of the OPTIMADE specification directly at this URL:

- [https://providers.optimade.org/providers.json](https://providers.optimade.org/providers.json)

You can contribute a new provider or amend the current information by creating a pull request to [the `providers` repository](https://github.com/Materials-Consortia/providers).


## Repository organization

The OPTIMADE providers repository is hosted here: [https://github.com/Materials-Consortia/providers](https://github.com/Materials-Consortia/providers)

The repository is organized this way:

- `/src/links/<version>/providers.json` is the current providers.json file formatted according to OPTIMADE version `<version>` and any later version that uses a format that is backward compatible with this version.

- `/src/info/<version>/info.json` is the proper response to the info endpoint formatted according to OPTIMADE version `<version>` and any later version that uses a format that is backward compatible with this version.

- `/_redirect` specify http rewrites to map index meta-database URLs `/<version>/info` and `/<version>/links` to the corresponding files under `src/`, as well as `/providers.json`.

- `/<version>` directories contain symlinks `info.html` and `links.html` to the corresponding files under `src/` to somewhat support hosting solutions that do not understand the instructions in `_redirect` but which support "pretty URLs".

- `/providers.json` is a symbolic link continously updated to point at the latest version of the providers.json file under `/src/` to somewhat support hosting solutions that do not understand the instructions in `_redirect`.

- `make_ghpages`: scripts to generate rendered versions of the provider lists, with checks and badges to get an overview
  of existing providers and databases. This is then pushed on GitHub pages.

Presently, only the `v1` version of the formats exist.
Hence, to update the list of providers, file a pull-request against the repository to edit `/src/links/v1/providers.json`.
